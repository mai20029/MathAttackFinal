==========

Mathattack is a game for cross-platform such as html, android, desktop. Based for educational purposes, this games offers our new generation to learn calculus while having fun and getting completed all the levels.

On the other hand the motor of this project is Libgdx, a powerful framework to create games.

## [Libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)

libGDX is a game-development application framework written in the Java programming language with some C and C++ components for performance dependent code. It allows for the development of desktop and mobile games by using the same code base. It is cross-platform, supporting Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, and web browsers with WebGL support.

## [MoribitoTech](http://moribitotechx.blogspot.com.es/)
Especial thanks to MoribitoTechX for developing a framework called Mtx which is open source and available by clicking the following [MTX](https://github.com/moribitotech/MTX).

This project has used this framework as a project template and the Math Attack team gives the whole credit to the developers of MTX. Also clearing that most of the initial code has been used from MTX and we do not take any CREDIT of creating it.

## Importing Your Project

Go to File -> Import -> Gradle -> Gradle Project, click Browse and navigate to the root folder of your project, then click Build Model. After a while, you'll see a root project and subprojects (android, core, desktop, html, ios). Select all the projects and click Finish. Note that this process can take a minute or two the first time you do it, as Gradle and some dependencies will be downloaded in the background.
